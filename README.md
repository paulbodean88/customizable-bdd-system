# Why BDD
Behaviour driven development - software development approach derived from TDD. It's used mostly in a non tech language, 
which would be easily to read by both developers, clients.

Based on requirements, even the product owners/managers could interact with the test specifications

# Given-When-Then formula

Given the User has not entered any data on the form
When they click the submit button
Then proper validation messages should be show.

# BDD tools

### Behave -> https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html
### Cucumber -> https://docs.cucumber.io/guides/10-minute-tutorial/
### Define your own


#Benefits of using BDD
    You are no longer defining ‘test’, but are defining ‘behavior’.
    Better communication between developers, testers and product owners.
    Because BDD is explained using simple language, the learning curve will be much shorter.
    Being non-technical in nature, it can reach a wider audience.
    The behavioral approach defines acceptance criteria prior to development
#Disadvantages of BDD
    To work in BDD, prior experience of TDD is required. BDD is incompatible with the waterfall approach.
    If the requirements are not properly specified, BDD may not be effective.
    Testers using BDD need to have sufficient technical skills.


### Why to use your own system
* No platform specific dependencies
* Even if it's time consuming it would be easy to adapt the user scenario parser
* Test input data could be easily manipulated in your own way
